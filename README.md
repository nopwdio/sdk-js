# Nopwd javascript sdk

To all who come here... welcome!

This is the repo for our javascript sdk.
This repo contains all the source code we use to build our js library.

## What is it?

Nopwd is a set of **web components** and API to authenticate your users using email link or Passkeys authentication.

> Nopwd is still in beta. API and components may change and not production ready at this time.

Check out our [demo website](https://nopwd.rocks) to see it live :)

## Why?

Authentication is used to be hard for users but also for developers. At Nopwd, we work hard to keep our API simple and minimal ðŸ’†.
Using Nopwd, you wonâ€™t have to:

- give us money (but you can still support us ðŸ˜…)
- register your app or website
- manage any API Key or secrets

## How to install it?

You can load our web components via CDN or by installing it locally using package manager such as NPM.

### using CDN

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nopwdio/sdk-js@latest/cdn/components/np-email-auth.js"
></script>
```

### using NPM

```bash
npm i @nopwdio/sdk-js@latest

## How to add magic-link authentication?

```html
<np-email-auth></np-email-auth>

<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("np-email-auth");
  button.email = "...";

  // ...and retrieve the access token by listening the "np:login" event. You're done!
  button.addEventListner("np:login", (e) => {
    // Your are authenticated ðŸŽ‰
    const { expires_at, token } = e.detail;
  });
</script>
```

## How to add Passkeys authentication?

```html
<np-passkey-conditional></np-passkey-conditional>

<script>
  const input = document.querySelector("np-passkey-conditional");

  input.addEventListner("np:login", (e) => {
